					<h6>COMPUTATIONAL BENEFITS OF EXPANSION AND SPARSITY IN NEURAL NETWORKS</h6><!-- headline-->
					<p>This project investigates the computational benefits of expansion and sparsity in neural systems for processing clustered sensory inputs, inspired by Babadi and Sompolinsky's 2014 study. The focus is on how expansion (increasing the number of neurons in downstream populations compared to input pathways) and sparsity (few neurons being active at a time) affect variability and noise in clustered sensory data. Unlike the original study, which used a binary classification task, this project applies these principles to a linear regression task to further explore the computational advantages of this approach.</p><br><!-- About Text 1 -->

					<h6>LOW-COST AUTOMATIC FEEDING PUMP</h6><!-- Headline -->
					<p>This project addresses premature death caused by respiratory distress syndrome and malnutrition in preterm babies, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Due to immature neurophysiological functions, preterm babies cannot coordinate their own feeding, leading to a high reliance on healthcare professionals for manual feeding, as affordable automatic systems are lacking. The project's goal was to design an automated feeding system that accurately delivers breast milk to premature infants while considering local constraints, reducing the burden on healthcare workers and improving the precision of feeding. The system allows clinicians to input flow rate and volume, which is processed by a microprocessor to deliver the nutrition accurately. The design includes an LCD, sensors, LEDs, a buzzer, a peristaltic pump, and a microprocessor. It successfully delivers breast milk at flow rates between 5-15 ml per minute (with a maximum error margin of ±3 ml) and volumes between 20-60 ml.</p><br><!-- About Text 2 -->

					<h6>AUTOMATED LANE DETECTION AND LABELING IN GEL ELECTROPHORESIS FOR LARGE-SCALE DATA ANALYSIS</h6><!-- Headline-->
					<p>This project automates the detection and labeling of lanes in 96-well plate gel electrophoresis images to streamline the analysis of large datasets. This involves utilizing image preprocessing and object detection techniques with OpenCV to identify bands, generate bounding boxes, and calculate lane numbers based on ladder positions. The algorithm was tested on 3000 images, achieving an 83% success rate on images with lane widths of 9 and 10 but was less effective on images with broader lanes. Enhancing the algorithm's adaptability to various lane widths could establish it as a valuable automated tool for accurately labeling gel electrophoresis images, thus optimizing the efficiency of biological data analysis.</p><br><!-- About Text 3 -->

This study sought to understand the evolutionary drivers of neural motor control circuits, providing insights for optimizing artificial neural controllers. In this computational investigation, we successfully evolved artificial neural circuit architectures to control a worm-like body in various swimming tasks using Genetic Algorithms (GA). The evolved architectures were compared with the well-documented biological neural circuits of the nematode C. elegans, as well as manually designed neural architectures inspired by it. Comparisons were made in terms of performance, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. By systematically varying task complexity, environmental conditions, and specific constraints related to behavior and circuit properties, we identified conditions that particularly favored the evolution of flexibility, robustness, and energy efficiency in the resulting architectures. These findings contribute to our understanding of both biological and artificial neural controllers, providing a foundation for designing more effective and efficient artificial systems.

Successful detection and matching allowed automated gate operation, enhancing both security and user convenience. Throughout the development, various configurations were tested to ensure reliable detection under different conditions, such as varying lighting and environmental factors, while also ensuring robustness in matching algorithms. The resulting system was able to handle real-time detection and provide rapid gate access, thus streamlining the entry process for authorised vehicles.

The study explored functional connectivity and power spectral density differences in motor-related brain regions using electrocorticography (ECoG) data from epileptic patients. The dataset included ECoG recordings from seven patients performing both real and imagined hand and tongue movements. We focused on regions of interest such as the primary motor cortex, sensory-motor cortex, premotor and supplementary motor cortices, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our analysis involved comparing functional connectivity and spectral features between the conditions using SVM classification and coherence analysis. The results revealed minimal differences, with classification accuracy only slightly above chance, suggesting similar voltage and power spectral density distributions in both MI and M. The study demonstrates the need for improved models and methods to analyze the data effectively. This project contributes to understanding brain activity in motor tasks, emphasizing the need to explore new approaches to differentiate motor imagery from overt movement.
